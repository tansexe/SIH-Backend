# SIH Problem Statement 

###  1. Current Challenges: 
The current bus scheduling process is manual, leading to inefficiencies and errors. Manual methods require significant time and effort from staff. Existing route planning lacks data-driven optimization, leading to potential overlaps and inefficiencies in route coverage.
### 2. Objectives:
- Automation: Develop a system to automate the scheduling of buses and crews.
- Route Management: Create tools for visualizing and managing existing and new bus routes.
- Optimization: Improve resource utilization by optimizing schedules and routes.
### 3. Key Features:
- Linked Duty Scheduling: Assign specific crews to buses for their entire shift. Manage crew and bus assignments for consistency and accountability.
- Unlinked Duty Scheduling: Allow crew members to hand over buses after completing trips. Manage rest periods and reassign crews to different buses efficiently.
- Route Management: Map existing routes and provide visual representations of the bus network. Enable users to create new routes and automatically detect overlaps with existing ones. Optimize route planning to reduce congestion and improve service coverage.
